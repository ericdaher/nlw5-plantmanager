<h1 align="center">PlantManager</h1>

<p>This project made during RocketSeat's NLW#05, using ReactNative and TypeScript. It's an application that helps you remember that you have to water your plants, using notifications on your phone.</p>

<h4 align="center">Technology</h4>
<p>PlantManager was made with <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">ReactNative</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>. Also, <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> was used as a development environment</p>

<h4 align="Center">Running</h4>
<p>You'll need Expo CLI installed globally, as there's no APK or iOS version available.</p>
<p>Run it locally:</p>

```bash
# Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ericdaher/nlw5-plantmanager

# Go to folder
$ cd nlw5-plantmanager
